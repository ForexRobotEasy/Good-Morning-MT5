## Description

Good Morning MT5 Forex Software is a trading algorithm developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to trade the Forex market during the opening of the European session. The software utilizes a range-based strategy combined with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator to identify potential trade opportunities.

The software offers various input parameters that can be customized according to the trader's preferences. These parameters include the calculation period for the price range, the size of candles for range calculation, the period for the RSI indicator, the take profit and stop loss levels for trades, the volume mode (fixed, risk-based, or auto), and other options such as enabling the grid system.

The algorithm uses the OnInit() function to initialize the trading strategy. It checks the spread and pauses trading if it is too high. It also calculates the high and low range levels based on the specified period.

The OnTick() function is responsible for executing trades. It checks if it's the opening of the European session and calculates the RSI value. If the price is within the range, it opens short trades in the upper part of the range or long trades in the lower part of the range. The number of trades opened depends on the grid system option.

The GetVolume() function is used to determine the trading volume based on the selected volume mode. It can be either a fixed volume, a volume calculated based on the risk percentage and account equity, or an auto-calculated volume based on the trader's logic.

The OnTester() function is used for optimization and backtesting purposes. Traders can implement their optimization and backtesting logic in this function.

The OnDeinit() function is called when the software is stopped or removed. Traders can implement their logical conclusion logic in this function.
